== Notes on Chat Platform Support

=== No Emoji or Auto-Linking in HipChat

Messages sent to HipChat will not render emoji, or auto-link URLs and mention names. This is a limitation of HipChat's APIs at the moment, which do not allow for such things in HTML-formatted messages sent to chat rooms.

HipChat issue https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/HCPUB-1130[HCPUB-1130] tracks this situation.
