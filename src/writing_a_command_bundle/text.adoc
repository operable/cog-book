== Writing A Command Bundle

At some point in your use of Cog, you'll want to write some command
bundles of your own. One of the promises of ChatOps is the ability to
bring your processes into the shared space of your chat system,
lowering the bar for collaboration, and increasing
participation. Chances are you've already got a number of programs and
scripts that you already use to run your systems. Fortunately, using
those tools in Cog doesn't require shoe-horning them into a particular
application framework, or rewriting them into a new programming
language. Instead, Cog's interface relies on the fundamental building
blocks of standard input, standard output, and environment variables.

In this chapter we'll show you how to take a standalone program and
gradually write adapter code to make it interoperate with
Cog. We'll examine Cog's usage of input, output, and environment
variables. We'll learn how to describe a bundle to Cog. We'll also see
how to package your code and run it on Relay, Cog's execution
engine. Along the way, we'll also discover what is necessary if you'd
like to write your own language-specific interaction library to
abstract the lower-level details of the Cog - command interaction.

Our framework for examining all these points will be the creation of a
bundle that interacts with https://twitter.com[Twitter]. For those
wanting to skip ahead, the "real" version of this bundle can be found
online at https://github.com/cogcmd/twitter. This chapter traces the
techniques and thought processes a developer might go through to
arrive at that finished product.

=== Scenario: Tweet from Cog

Transparency during service incidents is essential to maintaining the
trust of your users. When your API slows down, you experience a
hardware failure, or have a service outage, your users will be
affected. They need to know that you are aware of the problem, and
they need to know that you're working to remedy the situation.

https://twitter.com[Twitter] is a popular platform for companies to quickly update their
users on their system statuses. Wouldn't it be nice if you could
easily send a tweet from your company's status account from your chat
window as you and your colleagues work to remedy the situation? The
people closest to the situation could quickly get the word out,
without having to track down the person in the company that has the
account's login information.

Let's imagine what that might look like:

.Desired Interface for _twitter:tweet_ Command
====
@cog twitter:tweet Currently experiencing API slowdowns; investigating.
====

With a command like this, you and your colleagues could post status
updates directly from chat. Of course, it would be useful for more
than just status updates. For instance, you could also wire it up into
pipelines and triggers to augment other workflows; perhaps you could
automatically tweet when your CI system finishes a new product
release? The brave among you could even create an alias to "OH" your
colleagues' witty observations. Sending a tweet is a very simple task,
but by adding this simple task to Cog, you can unlock a number of
incredibly useful abilities. How much moreso with the more
sophisticated tools you already have?

=== Tweet from Plain Ruby

The first thing we need to do before we can send a tweet from Cog is
figure out how to send a tweet, period. To make things easy, we'll
take advantage of the `twitter` Ruby gem
(https://github.com/sferik/twitter) and build our solution on top of
it.

[NOTE]
For this example, we're using Ruby for the heavy lifting of
sending a tweet, but don't be put off if you're not a Ruby
programmer. The code is short, and the details are, in any event,
tangential to learning how Cog interacts with it.

[NOTE]
====
If you'd like to follow along, you'll need a Twitter account, as well as the required tokens to interact with the Twitter API. This will require creating an "application" under your account. Go to https://apps.twitter.com to learn more. While you're there, you'll need to generate the following credentials:

* Consumer Key
* Consumer Secret
* Application Token
* Application Token Secret
====

.`tweet` Command, Pure Ruby
[source,ruby]
----
include::code/pure_ruby/tweet.rb[]
----
<1> Here, we establish a connection to the Twitter API, using our API credentials, stored as environment variables.
<2> Next, we'll assemble a message to send by combining all the command line arguments into a single string. This allows us to invoke our command like `twitter:tweet this is a tweet`, or `twitter:tweet "this is a tweet". The former is often more convenient, but the latter is needed when the message contains special characters, like "!".
<3> here, we actually send the message to Twitter.
<4> Finally, we'll return some information to standard output so we can find out the URL of our new tweet. There is other information we could add (like timestamp, tweet ID, etc.), but for now, we'll keep it simple.

It's not a lot of code, and running it is pretty straightforward.

.Executing the Pure Ruby `tweet` Command
[source,bash]
----
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=XXXX
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=XXXX
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=XXXX
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=XXXX

./tweet.rb This is an interesting tweet
----

Running that yields the following output:
----
Message: This is an interesting tweet
URL:     https://twitter.com/CogTesting/status/776900296802992128
----

And we can see our tweet online, as well.

// TODO: This isn't a picture of that URL ^^^
image::images/first_tweet.png["tweet!"]

=== First Steps Toward Cog: Arguments

Our tweet code is simple, and so getting it to run in Cog should also
be pretty simple. With the code we have, we'll need to take care of
two things: arguments and our authentication tokens. We'll tackle
arguments first.

Recall our desired interface for our `tweet` command:

----
@cog twitter:tweet Currently experiencing API slowdowns; investigating
----

The string `twitter:tweet` is the name of our command, and everything
that follows is the message we'd like to send. If this were a
traditional terminal program, each word after `twitter:tweet` would be
an individual argument ("Currently", "experiencing", "API", etc.). As
Cog commands are heavily influenced by the idioms and architecture of
the UNIX command line, it should come as no surprise to know that Cog
views these as arguments, as well.

In fact, if you have ever programmed in C before, the environment
variables Cog uses to represent these arguments will look familiar.

* +COG_ARGC+ - **COG ARG**ument **C**ount = how many arguments were passed
* +COG_ARGV_0+ - **COG ARG**ument **0** = the first argument
* +COG_ARGV_1+ - **COG ARG**ument **1** = the second argument

and so on.

Using the values of these environment variables, a command can
reconstruct the arguments in whatever form is most natural for its
implementation language (e.g., as an array, vector, etc.). Though it's
not hard to write that code, it can be tedious to do it more than
once; this is where the use of language-specific libraries can be
useful; later, we'll take a look at `cog-rb`, the Ruby library for Cog
commands later in the chapter.

There are two approaches we can take here. We could edit our Ruby code
to directly interface with Cog, assembling the message from the
`COG_ARG_*` variables instead of from `ARGV`. Alternatively, we could
put this logic into an adapter script that translates between the
interfaces of Cog and our tweet program. The former approach may be
more useful for very small or simple programs that will only be used
via Cog, while the latter can be more desirable for larger and more
complex programs, programs where the source code is not readily
accessible, or for programs that still need to be usable outside of a
Cog context.

As the adapter script approach is more flexible and more clearly
illustrates the underlying mechanics of the Cog interface, that is the
approach we'll take now. Let's pretend that `tweet.rb` is a program
that we have been using for years in our company, and that we would
now like to interface with Cog, without rewriting it.

(Later in the chapter, once we've gotten a better feel for how it all
works, we'll add some more commands using the more direct approach.)

We'll run our command from the command line using the following
code. As far as our command is concerned, this code _is_ Cog.

[source, bash]
----
include::code/pure_ruby_with_args/run.sh[]
----
<1> Here, we introduce Cog's environment variables into our runner script. This would correspond to `@cog twitter:tweet Hello World` in our chat provider. Cog will parse the `Hello World` message as two separate arguments.
<2> Instead of calling our Ruby code directly, we introduce a new wrapper script to process the Cog environment variables.

And here is what our Cog command looks like. Remember, this is acting
as an adapter that allows us to call our `tweet.rb` script from Cog.
We are not changing `tweet.rb` at all. This adapter script is the only
thing that is aware of Cog.

[source, bash]
.tweet_cog_wrapper.sh
----
include::code/pure_ruby_with_args/tweet_cog_wrapper.sh[]
----
<1> We need to pull out the `COG_ARGV_*` variables to pass as actual arguments to our Ruby script. Here, we loop as determined by the `COG_ARGC` variable, placing each `COG_ARGV_*` variable into a Bash array in turn.
<2> With the pieces of our message extracted from the environment, we can now call our Ruby script just as we have previously, passing the arguments as actual arguments.


.Why Environment Variables?
[TIP]
====
You might wonder why Cog would go to the trouble of turning the arguments

----
hello world
----

into the environment variables

----
COG_ARGC=2
COG_ARG_0=hello
COG_ARG_1=world
----

only to have our command turn those environment variables _back_ into
arguments that our Ruby code can process.

While each computer language has its own conventions and idioms, they
_all_ have ways to read environment variables (and consume standard
input and write to standard output, which we'll address soon.) By
basing its interaction model on universal components like environment
variables, Cog places no restrictions on what language commands are
written in. There are no "blessed" languages for Cog commands; you can
write commands in Fortran, COBOL, or Forth just as readily as you can
in Ruby or Python. It is completely transparent to Cog.
====

[TIP]
.Advantages of Adapters
====
Earlier, we briefly mentioned some reasons why you might want to write
an adapter script to interface Cog with existing tools you may already
use. We'll examine some of those reasons more in depth here. These
reasons are not mutually exclusive; more than one may be applicable in
any given situation.

* Proper Separation of Concerns

If you have code that already performs a task well, editing it to also
become aware of Cog calling conventions can violate the Single
Responsibility Principle and make the code more complex and harder to
maintain. Isolating the Cog interaction in an adapter can yield
software that is easier to maintain and test.

* Source Code is Not Required

You may wish to expose some software to Cog that you either do not
have the source code for, or for which altering the source code may be
impractical. By using an adapter, you can control how the executable
is called.

* Tools Must Remain Usable Outside of Cog

Some tools that you wish to use with Cog may also need to be usable
outside of Cog. In this case, changing the code to use Cog's calling
conventions may make use outside of Cog inconvenient and unwieldy
(imagine invoking such a command with four arguments, for instance).
Using an adapter allows Cog to call it, but also retains the more
familiar calling interface for existing users of the tools.

* Limit Capabilities Exposed to Chat

You may have existing tools with some features you would like to use
in chat, but others that are perhaps too dangerous, inapplicable, or
inappropriate for a chat context. By using an adapter, you can limit
what capabilities are made available to Cog.

====

=== Describe it to Cog: Bundle Definitions

Believe it or not, we're ready to start packing this up for
Cog. There's more to Cog commands than arguments, of course, but we're
now at a point where we can run what we have in Cog.

All Cog commands reside in a *bundle*, which is a collection of
related commands, along with metadata describing them. Right now, we
have the makings of a single-command bundle.

All bundles are described by a YAML file, which gives Cog all the
information it needs to properly interact with their commands. Let's
take a look at a minimal bundle definition file for our new `twitter`
bundle.

[TIP]
Bundle definition files are traditionally named `config.yaml`.

// TODO: Default syntax highlighter doesn't understand yaml!
.config.yaml
----
include::code/minimal_bundle/config.yaml[]
----

<1> Every bundle must declare which bundle definition schema version it uses. This determines which fields are expected, how their values are validated, and so on. At the time of writing, the current version is `4`.
<2> Every bundle must have a name. These must be unique within a Cog installation.
<3> While not strictly required, it is a good practice to include a brief description of the bundle. This will be displayed when listing bundles that are installed on a Cog system, helping users discover which commmands are available.
<4> This version pertains to the bundle definition artifact itself. Multiple versions of a bundle may be installed on a Cog system at one time, though only one may be active.
<5> In order for Cog to recognize a command, it must be described here in the `commands` section. The keys of this map are the command names, and the values are objects providing metadata about the command.
<6> The path to the actual program that contains the command logic. This is what we are writing!
<7> Though not required, describing the inputs your command takes is always a good idea.
<8> Cog has a comprehensive authorization system that allows you to define rules that govern who may execute a command. We'll explore this further in a bit, but for now, just remember that the special `allow` rule means that any Cog user will be able to execute this command.

Now that we've described our bundle, we need to upload this definition file to Cog.

=== Installing the Bundle

Once we have written bundle definition file, we need to load it into Cog. We'll use `cogctl`:

.Installing a Bundle
----
cogctl bundle install config.yaml --enable --relay-groups=default
----

Here, we do several things at once. First, we upload the contents of
our bundle definition to Cog. By adding the `--enable` flag, we also
make the described bundle active. Cog will accept invocations for
commands within the bundle and attempt to dispatch them; additionally,
if any other versions of this bundle were previously available and
enabled, this would ensure that the version we just uploaded was the
active one. Finally, we associate the bundle with one or more relay
groups, which governs which Relay servers will be responsible for
satisfying requests targeted at this bundle.

This is equivalent to:
----
cogctl bundle install config.yaml
cogctl bundle enable twitter_example 0.0.1
cogctl relay-groups assign default --bundles=twitter_example
----

If you look back at our bundle definition, you'll notice that the path
to the executable is on my workstation. When a Relay gets the request
to run the command, it will look at this path, which means that we'll
need to ensure that the Relay has all the requisite files installed
before a command will actually execute. For the purposes of
demonstration, we'll be running a Relay on the workstation, but for
real world usage, you'll want to take measures to install the needed
files in the correct place. Tools like https://chef.io[Chef],
https://puppet.com[Puppet], or https://www.ansible.com[Ansible] can
help with this.

TODO: Need to better describe a bundle development setup, either with
a Relay running locally, or with a Relay running in Docker.

TODO: I wanted to illustrate that a "native" bundle is possible, and
possibly emphasize the "changes are live immediately" aspect of
this. The new dev mode on Relay may make this more of a moot point,
though.

In a bit we'll update our bundle to use Docker, which greatly
simplifies bundle installation and maintenance.

TODO: Additional docs about how to start Cog, Relay, etc.

Once the bundle is installed, we can finally run it from chat!

image::images/tweet_minimal_bundle_failure.png["First try from Cog"]

Oh no! It looks like we can't authenticate with Twitter. But we've
still got our credentials in the environment, don't we?

=== Dynamic Configuration

Actually, we _don't_ have our credentials in the environment anymore,
mainly because we're now running the command under Relay and not our
runner script. When a command is executed by Relay, it injects
variables into the environment that each command receives. This is how
`COG_ARGC`, `COG_ARGV_0`, etc. get into place. Relay can also be
configured to inject additional arbitrary values into the environment
as well, but these will be _global_, applying to every single command
invocation that Relay services. While you _could_ add the variables
our `tweet` command is expecting to your Relay configuration, this
would create a huge security hole; every command would have access to
your Twitter credentials! Over time, this approach would also become
rather difficult to maintain as you added more bundles. Adding
environment variables like this to your global Relay configuration is
a Really Bad Idea, and we shall speak of it no further.

.Why would you want to add Environment Variables in Relay's Configuration?
[TIP]
====
We've established that adding environment variables containing
authentication tokens, passwords, and other secrets that individual
commands need to Relay's global configuration is a bad idea. Any
variables you add to this configuration should genuinely be
global. Some examples include ensure that certain supporting files are
available on the `PATH`, or that necessary libraries are on the search
paths of whatever language runtimes you might be using.
====

Instead, we'll let Cog manage these environment variables for us. This
way, the only commands that will get our Twitter authentication tokens
will be commands in our `twitter_example` bundle. We can also quickly
change the values centrally in Cog, and they will take effect across
all Relays almost instantly. We can even create "layered"
configurations, dynamically changing the values based on the user that
invokes a command, the chat room from which they invoke it, or a
combination of both. For now, though, we'll just deal with the simple
case.

Let's create another YAML file to contain your environment variables
(substituting `XXXX` with your real tokens, of course):

.dynamic_configuration.yaml
----
include::code/minimal_bundle/dynamic_configuration.yaml[]
----

TODO: Need to mention starting up Relay in managed config mode here.

This file is a simple map whose keys are the environment variable
names that the command expects (compare these to our original
`tweet.rb` file), and whose values are the, well, values those
variables should have. Remember that the values will be presented to
your code as strings (like all environment variables); if your code
expects different data types (integers, floats, booleans, etc.),
you'll need to handle that translation on your own (though this is
another thing that language-specific libraries could potentially
handle for you).

Uploading this file to Cog requires another `cogctl` invocation.

----
cogctl dynamic-config create twitter_example dynamic_configuration.yaml
----

Now, we should be able to run our command completely within Cog.

image::images/tweet_minimal_bundle_success_no_template.png[Success]

Success! Cog has captured the output of our tweet command and
presented it it in our chat client (Here, we're using Slack; the fancy
tweet display is due to Slack's handling of URLs, and is not something
specific to Cog).

We could declare victory here, but Cog can do more than just parrot
standard output back to chat. If we structure the output our command
returns to Cog, we can unlock richer output formatting, as well as
make the output more easily accessible to any downstream commands in a
pipeline.

=== Output

As we saw above, the standard output of a command gets returned back
to Cog and output in chat. Pipelines and most templates in Cog act on
JSON object inputs, though, not arbitrary text like traditional Unix
pipelines do. By structuring the output a bit, we can make our data
much more useful.

Let's update our adapter script to generate structured output.

[source,bash]
.tweet_cog_wrapper.sh with structured output
----
include::code/bundle_with_structured_output/tweet_cog_wrapper.sh[]
----
<1> Instead of returning the standard output directly to Cog, we'll capture it in our adapter script to perform some post-processing.
<2> Here, we use common Unix utilities to extract our tweet message and URL from the output. You can use whatever tools you like for this.
<3> If the output contains the string `"JSON"` on a line by itself, followed by a newline, the remainder of the output is treated as JSON. Here, we manually create a JSON version of the plain text output we were originally returning. Of course, you can generate JSON in any number of ways; we're taking the manual route here for demonstration purposes, and because the object itself is so simple.

The `JSON` tag in our output is a "command response attribute", one of
several that can be used by commands. We'll touch on a few more in
this chapter; for more details, see TODO: LINK TO REFERENCE
SECTION. The upshot is that when Relay detects these response
attributes in a command's output, it interprets them as special
instructions on how to handle that output. The `JSON` tag is probably
the most commonly used one.

Now, when we run our command through Cog, our output looks very
different.

image::images/tweet_structured_output.png[Structured Output]

We now see a pretty-printed version of our JSON in chat. Because we've
added structure, downstream commands can use our output, like so:

image::images/tweet_structured_output_pipeline.png[Extract structured output]

[NOTE]
.Why is our result wrapped in an array?
====
For a very good reason, trust us.
TODO: explain more
====

==== Templating Output

As interesting as pretty-printed JSON output is, it can be cumbersome
to deal with in chat. Though this particular command's output is not
so bad, imagine dealing with a large JSON object with 50 keys and
non-scalar values. It would be difficult to visually parse, and the
size of it alone would obscure the actual human conversations
happening, largely nullifying the benefits of "doing chatops" in the
first place. Favoring more complete outputs is good for maximum
flexibility in pipelines, but humans rarely need to see all that data
to get the situational awareness they need.

In order to address this, Cog commands can specify that their output
be rendered through a template, allowing Cog to present the most
salient information to humans, formatted by the conventions of your
chat client. Cog templates are written using
https://github.com/operable/greenbar[Greenbar], a templating language
written by Operable to satisfy the needs of Cog. It's probably best
described as a Markdown variant with support for ERB-like tags.

The time has come to add a template to our bundle. Here is what ours
will look like:

----
include::code/bundle_with_structured_output_and_templates/tweet.greenbar[]
----

TODO: why iterate over $results?

Given what we saw in the output before, we probably really only care
about the new tweet's URL. Modern chat platforms will generally
display the tweet for us based on that URL, and in any event, you can
always click that URL if you want to see the tweet. Our template here
simply extracts the URL from the JSON object our command now returns.

[NOTE]
.Templates are only for Final Display
====
Templates are only used for formatting the final output of a pipeline
for human consumption. If a command is not the last one in a pipeline,
any template information is ignored. Templates _do not_ "filter" the
output as it flows through a pipeline.
====

To make the template available to Cog, we must add it to our bundle
definition file.

----
include::code/bundle_with_structured_output_and_templates/config.yaml[]
----
<1> Note that we have updated the version of the bundle. You must do this if you want to upload a new definition with a new template, new command, or otherwise altered metadata.
<2> Here we have a new top-level section of the bundle: `templates`. The keys of this map are the names of templates, while the values are objects whose `body` key stores the literal text of the template.

Once we install this bundle there's one more modification we must make
to our adapter script. We must somehow inform Cog which template it
should use to format the output of the command. The solution is
similar to how we instructed Cog to treat our output as JSON: we'll
use a command response attribute.

[source,bash]
----
include::code/bundle_with_structured_output_and_templates/tweet_cog_wrapper.sh[]
----
<1> An output line that begins with `COG_TEMPLATE:` is a special command response attribute; whatever follows on that line is the name of a template _in that command's bundle_ that should be used for formatting. Our template is called "tweet", as defined in our bundle definition YAML `templates` section.

Bundles may include many templates, and since a command
programmatically indicates which template to use, any single command
may actually use more than one template (e.g., based on the result of
this invocation, use template `x`, but use template `y` if some other
result is generated). For any given output, however, only one template
may be used.

Running the command again in our chat client shows us the template in
action.

image::images/tweet_with_template.png[]

Here we see the output from Cog is just the tweet's URL, and not raw JSON.

.What Templates Take Unstructured Text?
[NOTE]
====
Earlier, we mentioned that "most" templates operate on structured JSON
input. There is one template (named "text") built into Cog itself that
takes unstructured text. This is automatically used when Cog detects
unstructured text output. It simply turns the text into an array of
strings (one for each line of output), and wraps it in a JSON object
with the text stored under a `body` key. In this way, Cog maintains
the uniform interface for command input and output.
====

.What if I Actually Want Raw JSON output?
[TIP]
====
If you really do want to see the raw JSON output of a pipeline,
instead of the templated output, simply pipe the results through the
`operable:raw` command.
====

=== Permissions and Rules

Earlier, we entirely bypassed the notions of permissions and
authorization rules for our `tweet` command. We were focused more on
figuring out how to make our command work; adding Cog's authorization
system into the mix would potentially complicate things.

Now that our command works, however, it's time to revisit. While
sending a tweet from chat can be useful, we may not want everybody
with access to our chat system to be able to send a tweet from our
account.

[NOTE]
.Rules are Advisory
====
If you include rules in a bundle you've written, users are not
required to use them. They will be installed along with the bundle,
and will be actively enforced, but administrators are free to remove
them and add their own, even their own `allow` rule, which lets
anybody use the command.

As a bundle author, don't go overboard creating elaborate rules for
your bundle, particularly if it's to be shared outside your
organization. Think of the rules you provide as a sensible foundation
that others may build upon.
====

Let's make it so only a subset of users will be able to send a
tweet. We'll add a `twitter_example:tweet` permission to the bundle,
as well as a rule for the command.

----
include::code/bundle_with_permissions/config.yaml[]
----
<1> We're adding to the bundle, so we bump the version
<2> A new `permissions` key holds a list of permissions used across the entire bundle. Customarily, there is a permission for each command.
<3> We replace our "allow" rule with a new one that states that anyone excuting our tweet command must have been granted the `twitter_example:tweet` permission.

Once we've installed this new version, let's try it out.

image::images/tweet_permission_denied.png[]

Looks like I don't have permission to send tweets anymore! (Probably
for the best; distributing puppies along with open source software
sounds like a logistical nightmare.) This is expected, though. We just
restricted who can run our command, but didn't grant anybody
permissions. In fact, at this stage, _no_ Cog users in this system
could execute this command. This is why it is actually safe to include
default authorization rules within bundle. Bundle rules may only
reference bundle permissions, and until someone has been granted those
permissions, Cog will deny execution of the restricted commands. This
allows administrators to roll out use of commands to users at their
leisure.

Each command in a bundle may have multiple rules specified; when a
user invokes a command with multiple rules, only one of them needs to
match for the user to be able to execute the command. Bundles may
contain a mix of commands that are restricted by authorization rules
and commands that are unrestricted (i.e., have a rule of `allow`).

// TODO: How much do we want to talk about groups, roles, and permissions here?

After granting myself the permission (I am an administrator on my own
system!), I'm once again able to tweet.

image::images/tweet_permission_granted.png[]

Whoever let me tweet from the company account clearly exhibited poor
judgement.

At this point, we've brought our original `tweet.rb` script into
Cog. We glossed over some points earlier, but have a good foundation
in the basics now. Let's circle back to touch on those points now, as
we expand the capabilities of our bundle.

=== Options: Tweet from different accounts

We've seen how to deal with arguments in a Cog command, but they can
also have options as well. Let's see how they are represented as we
add the ability to tweet from multiple accounts to our command.

Always tweeting from the same account, while useful, can be a bit
limiting. If you have both a status account and a marketing account,
you very well may want to tweet from either one using Cog. We can add
this ability to our command by adding a new option; let's call it
`--as`. Here's what we want it to look like:

----
@cog twitter_example:tweet --as=status "All systems are normal"
@cog twitter_example:tweet --as=marketing "We shipped version 1.0.0!"
----

(You could call the option something like `--account` if you like, but
`--as` reads nicely.)

To support this, we'll need to be sure that the authentication tokens
for each account are available to the command. Based on the value of
the `--as` option, we can then select which of these sets of tokens
we'll actually use. If no `--as` option is supplied, we can fall back
to a default account.

Let's take a look at how our dynamic configuration for this bundle
will need to change.

----
include::code/bundle_with_options/dynamic_configuration.yaml[]
----
<1> We introduce a new variable indicating which set of credentials to use if no `--as` option is supplied.
<2> We have changed the names of the environment variables by adding a suffix. This set will be used when the value of `--as` is "STATUS".
<3> We can add as many sets of credentials as we wish to support; as long as the variable names have distinct suffixes, everything is fine.

Next, let's see how our bundle definition needs to change to add this
option.

----
include::code/bundle_with_options/config.yaml[]
----
<1> Again, we bump the version of our bundle
<2> Each command can have an `options` map; the keys are the option's "long name", and the value object describes additional metadata about the option.

Finally, we modify our adapter script now to see how to access this option.

<1> Here we test to see if there is a value for the `COG_OPT_AS` variable. All option values are presented this way, using the uppercased "long name" of the option (thus a "foo" option would be accessed as `COG_OPT_FOO`, etc.) A `COG_OPTS` variable is also supplied, the value of which is a comma-delimited list of options present for the invocation. This is used to indicate which environment variables need to be checked. For our adapter script, however, which is coded specifically for this one-option command, `COG_OPTS` does not provide much benefit.
<2> We'll just uppercase the account identifier, which creates a more pleasing user experience; it's easier to type "--as=status" than "--as=STATUS", after all.
<3> Based on the account we want to use, we'll set the environment variables our command expects to their appropriate values.

Observe again that we haven't touched our underlying Ruby script at
all since we initially wrote it.

Let's take a look at it in action.

=== Packaging with Docker

Up until now, we've been installing our command executable on the
Relay directly. While this is sometimes convenient, you often want
automation for deploying commands. While you can use automation tools
like Chef, Puppet, or Ansible to do this, Relay also has built-in
support for deploying bundles as Docker containers. In fact, as long
as your container repository is accessible by your Relay server, all
you need to do to completely install a bundle is to upload the
definition YAML file to Cog, and everything else is taken care of for
you. We'll package up our bundle into a Docker container now.

[NOTE]
====
A full explanation of Docker is beyond the scope of this chapter. For
resources, please visit https://www.docker.com.
====

We're shooting for a minimal container here, so we're building on
https://alpinelinux.org[Alpine Linux], a lightweight distribution
based on https://busybox.net[BusyBox].

----
include::code/dockerize/Dockerfile[]
----

After a bit of experimentation, we've narrowed down our system
dependencies to the minimum needed to run our command. We also create
a bundle user, copy our existing code into that user's home directory,
and install our code dependencies. Finally, we drop privileges to
become our bundle user.

Creating the image is simple
----
docker build -t cog-book/twitter .
----

Now we need to tell Cog that this bundle is a Docker bundle, and which
image should be used to run it.

----
include::code/dockerize/config.yaml[]
----
<1> Bump the version; you know the drill by now
<2> Docker-enabled bundles have a `docker` configuration section, indicating exactly which container should be used. We use the same image name that we built our Dockerfile with. Specifying "latest" for the tag will cause Relay to pull the most recent version of the image when running the commmands from the bundle. This is useful for local development, and potentially for other specialized use cases, but for a proper release, you'll want to both build your image with a specific tag, and also lock your bundle to tht tag.
<3> We've changed the path to the executable. This is from inside the container, so it needs to match up with where the code was installed when the image was built.

Once we install it, we can see from Relay's logs that it has been
notified and is downloading the image:

----

And it works!

=== Handling Input

We've got a nice little bundle going here, but amazingly, we've not
really gotten into one of Cog's more exciting features: pipelines!

Earlier we saw a basic pipeline (TODO Link to earlier image) where we
explicitly pulled out the `message` field from our `tweet` command's
output to use in the following `echo` command invocation. When you do
this, Cog itself handles the extraction, and your commands don't have
to know anything about how the prior output was structured; it would
be a bit odd for the `echo` command --- something built into Cog ---
to know how a `tweet` result was structured, particularly since we
just wrote it). This is very important for being able to chain
together commands from a variety of different bundles.

However, a bundle will often include multiple commands, which may
operate on a common structure. In _this_ case, it can be convenient to
have the commands operate on the implicit input received from a
previous pipeline stage. This data is presented to the command as a
JSON string on standard input. With this, you can create some rather
concise pipelines. Let's examine how this works in practice by
introducing another command to our bundle.

==== Tweet Statistics: Favorites and Retweets

We can get some basic statistics from the Twitter API for our
tweets. Let's say you've just announced the release of version 1.0 of
your software product on Twitter, and you're curious to see what kind
of traction it's getting in terms of favorites and retweets. Using the
`twitter` Ruby gem once again, we can write a small script that finds
this information for a given tweet. Let's take a look:

[source,ruby]
----
include::code/stats_command/stats.rb[]
----
<1> Though we're talking about processing input from previous pipeline stages, we shouldn't _require_ that (otherwise our command could never be called on its own, because there would be no previous stage to feed it!). If our command is passed an argument (in this case the URL of a tweet), then that is what it will operate on.
<2> On the other hand, if we don't receive an argument, we'll read standard input as a JSON map, and extract the `url` field from it. Remember, we're handling the case where we're receiving a map that looks like what our `tweet` command produces.
<3> This call simply "rehydrates" a Ruby tweet object from the URL. From this we can extract the number of favorites and retweets the tweet has. We'll output plain text, just as we did in our original `tweet.rb` script.

As before, we'll set up a small runner script in Bash to see how Cog sends the data to the command.

[source,bash]
.run_stats.sh
----
include::code/stats_command/run_stats.sh[]
----
<1> If we call the runner with an argument, we'll turn it into a `COG_ARGC` and `COG_ARG_0`
// TODO: do this in the previous runner script
<2> any standard input will get passed along to the script. This is how we'll simulate output from a prior pipeline stage.

[source,bash]
----
include::code/stats_command/stats_cog_wrapper.sh[]
----
<1> Here we extract the Cog environment variables into arguments, as we did for our original `tweet` command.
<2> We pass the arguments (if any) as arguments to the Ruby script, as well as standard input.
<3> As with our earlier `tweet` command, we extract bits of the output and put them into a JSON object suitable for templating or further downstream processing

We can run this on the command line like so:

----
echo '{"url": "https://twitter.com/CogTesting/status/778312086568968193"}' | ./run_stats.sh
COG_TEMPLATE: tweet-stats
JSON
{
 "url": "https://twitter.com/CogTesting/status/778312086568968193",
 "favorites": "1",
 "retweets": "1"
}
----

// TODO: The problem with this is that we don't have a "recent_tweets" command yet... we want to show that flowing into this for maximum impact.

==== Feeding the Stats Command with a Recent Tweets Command

You may have noticed a bit of a flaw in the usecase for our `stats`
command as we've laid it out so far. Right now the only really useful
command we have to feed input into it is our `tweet` command, but
there's not a whole lot of utility in sending a tweet and then
_immediately_ seeing how many favorites and retweets it's gotten. A
better use would be having a command that could generate a number of
tweets, and then pipe them through our stats command. This will also
reveal an interesting thing about how input is handled in pipelines.

Let's say we'd like to see how well our most recent tweets are being
received. If we had a command that pulled back, say, the last 5 tweets
we've sent from our account, we could pipe these through our `stats`
command and get a quick snapshot of how well our tweets are doing.

For brevity's sake, with this command, we'll shift gears from our
"wrap existing commands for Cog" approach, and just write this script
as though it were destined for Cog and only Cog.

[source,ruby]
----
include::code/recent_tweets_command/recent_tweets.rb[]
----
<1> Here we call the API client method that retrieves tweets from our authenticated user. As called here, this will result in no more than 5 tweets. This is configurable, however; a refinement of this command could involve accepting an optional number of tweets to retrieve.
<2> As before, we specify our template to use. Notice, however, that we're using the same template as our earlier `tweet` command. This is intentional; we're generating the same "shape" of data, and so it's natural that we'd template it the same way. A command can use any template within its own bundle.
<3> Here we generate the JSON string to send back, but notice this time we're sending back an array of objects; in our `tweet` and `stats` command we only sent back a single object.

Let's dig into that last point a bit. Our `tweet` command returns a
single JSON object, and our `stats` command can optionally _receive_ a
single JSON object, but our `recent_tweets` command returns an
_multiple_ JSON objects. Don't worry, though; our `stats` command
won't break when we pipe our `recent_tweets` into it. On the server,
Cog accumulates all output it receives into a single flat list, and
then doles this output one-by-one to the command in the next stage of
the pipeline. If you're familiar with functional programming, Cog acts
a bit like a map function when processing pipelines. It takes the
accumulated output it receives from one command, and then dispatches
to the following command once for each item it has accumulated. By
default, commands can just assume they'll receive a single object to
act upon, which makes them simpler to implement.

(There are some commands that do need to operate on the aggregate of
output, however; things like `filter`, `sort`, `min`, `max`, and so
on. These commands behave a bit differently, and we'll discuss that in
SECTION TODO.)

// TODO: A diagram of this would be really nice (perhaps not in this chapter, though)

image::images/tweet_stats_pipeline.png[]

=== Error Handling

If we try to execute our `recent_tweets` command (or indeed, _any_ of
these commands we've been working on) with incorrect authorization
tokens, our commands will fail, but Cog will present us with a nicely
formatted error message. We don't need to write any code in our
command to get that behavior; Cog gives it to us for free, which is
nice. We also get a rather ugly Ruby stack trace in that error
message, which is quite as nice. We'll now take a look at how we get
this behavior, and how we can intentionally manipulate it.

image::images/tweet_recent_tweets_unauthorized_stack_trace.png[]

If you've ever done any command line scripting, you'll likely be
familiar with the concept of ``exit codes''. Essentially, these are
numerical codes that indicate whether a program exited successfully or
with an error (and if so, which error). An exit code of 0 is regarded
as successful, while the numbers 1 and higher indicate errors. The
same holds for Cog commands. All our successful commands finished
executing on our Relay with an exit code of 0. Our failure to
authenticate with Twitter actually raised an exception which we did
not catch in our code, which ultimately ended up with our command
failing with an exit code of 1. The stack trace that shows up in
the error message was actually output on standard error, which Relay
is also monitoring. If a command exits with a non-zero exit code,
Relay captures the standard error stream of the command and sends that
back to Cog, with an indication that the command has failed. Cog's
internal processing then takes over to render that as the error
message we see in chat.

With this knowledge, we now know how we can control command
errors. Let's update our `recent_tweets.rb` script and see how we can
hide that ugly Ruby stack trace and make a more friendly error message
for our users.

[source,ruby]
----
include::code/error_handling/recent_tweets.rb[]
----
<1> Since our command was initially failing due to an uncaught exception, we'll wrap our code in a `begin`/`rescue` construct.
<2> When we have bad tokens, the code will throw a `Twitter::Error::Unauthorized` exception. We'll explicitly handle that scenario here. You can create as many `rescue` clauses as there are specific exceptions you'd like to deal with, or you could just have a "catch-all" `rescue` clause; it's up to you.
<3> After we output a custom error message on standard error, we quit the program with a non-zero exit code.

Now, when we run the command with bad tokens, we'll get a much nicer output.

=== Debugging

When developing a command, not everything will work out the first
time. Often, one of the simplest ways to figure out where your code
has gone wrong is by tracing it using logging statements. Cog commands
support this using the command response attributes `COGCMD_DEBUG`,
`COGCMD_INFO`, `COGCMD_WARN`, and `COGCMD_ERROR`. Emitting a line
starting with these flags (followed by a colon) will result in the
remainder of the line being sent to Relay's log file at the specified
logging level.

You are free to interleave "real" output with logging output like this
without worry; Relay will keep them separate. Only your "real" output
will make it to Cog, while the logging information will only show up
in the log file. The only exception to this is with the `JSON` reponse
attribute. Once that attribute has been emitted, everything that
follows on standard output must be a legal JSON string.

Let's modify our `recent_tweets.rb` script to see how this would look
in practice. We'll ad a few logging messages at various levels to
illustrate.

[source,ruby]
----
include::code/debugging/recent_tweets.rb[]

And here is what it looks like in Relay's logs once we execute the
command. Note that the unique pipeline ID (the `P` in parentheses) as
well as the complete command name (the `C`) are included for you
automatically.

=== Summary

In this chapter we've taken a look at the low-level underpinnings of
the Cog/Command interface. Since this interface is based on the
fundamental building blocks of environment variables, standard input,
standard output, and exit codes, Cog commands can be written in any
programming language.

We've also looked at techniques for developing commands and bundles,
using existing programs you already use, or writing new Cog-specific
commands from scratch. We've explored techniques for designing
composable commands.  Note that each one of these commands we wrote is
very small; pretty much all they do is make a single API call! Yet
from these simple commands, we can chain them together to make some
exciting workflows.

We started with the simple idea of being to update our company's
Twitter status account during an incident, a usecase generally of
interest to ops and engineering groups. However, as we went along, we
started adding features that would be useful to other parts of the
company; engineering probably doesn't care a whole lot about how many
retweets their status messages get, but marketing would care a lot
about how many retweets a product release tweet got. ChatOps isn't
just for the ops and engineers; it's something the whole company can
use.
