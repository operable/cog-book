== Installation Guide

So, you're ready to get in there and give Cog a shot? Well, you're in luck.
We've made it pretty straight forward to get up and running whether you want to
use our recommended Docker Compose configuration or manually build and run Cog
on your own. In this guide, we'll walk you through:

  * Installing and Running Cog with Docker Compose
  * Connecting Cog to Slack
  * Installing and Configuring a Bundle
  * Running a Command Pipeline

If you don't want to use Docker Compose to install Cog or you want to connect
to HipChat instead of Slack, take a look at the alternative sections below:

  * <<Building and Running Cog from Scratch>>
  * <<Connecting Cog to HipChat>>

NOTE: If you have any trouble during this guide or just want to ask a question,
head on over to the http://slack.operable.io[Cog Public Slack channel] to get
help from the core team, or even the author of this guide.

=== Installing and Running Cog with Docker Compose

We've provided a set of docker-compose files for running and configuring Cog:
`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.common.yml` and
`docker-compose.override.slack_example.yml` for running and configuring Cog. To
run the images specified in the `docker-compose.yml` you'll need to have both
Docker and Docker Compose installed. If you'd rather manually build and install
Cog, skip down to the next section titled, <<Building and Running Cog from Scratch>>.

First, make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed. If you haven't
installed Docker, we recommend using
https://www.docker.com/products/docker[Docker for Mac] (or the native
application for your OS), but you can also use `docker-machine` with a bit of
configuration. Then, you'll also need to install docker-compose. You can follow
any of the directions posted on https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker
Compose's installation guide].

Next, we'll need to grab the `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.common.yml`
and `docker-compose.override.slack_example.yml` files from the Cog repo.

If you'd rather connect Cog to HipChat, skip down to the section titled
<<Connecting Cog to HipChat>>.

[source,bash]
----
curl -o docker-compose.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operable/cog/0.16.2/docker-compose.yml

curl -o docker-compose.common.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operable/cog/0.16.2/docker-compose.common.yml

curl -o docker-compose.override.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operable/cog/0.16.2/docker-compose.override.slack_example.yml
----

The `docker-compose.yml` defines which images to run and how they'll talk to
each other, while `docker-compose.common.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml`
set values for the environment variables passed into each container. The
default `docker-compose.override.yml` has everything you'll need to start a
working Cog instance. But, we recommend that you set each environment variable
starting with `BOOTSTRAP` to automatically create an admin user for yourself
upon startup.

Ok, we're almost ready to start Cog, but one last thing we'll need is a bot
token so Cog can connect to our Slack channel. Head over to the
https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot[New Bot Integration Page], create a new
bot, and copy the newly generated token; it should look something like
`xoxb-87931061512-4m0DshC79h8tLNjTMuxxozUo`.

While you are over in Slack making your bot, add a cute Cog avatar too. Find a Cog avatar and other Cog branded goodies in the https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9shLHjT25r-SkhqSTU2MG05dG8[Operable + Cog Brand Folder]


You'll also need to export a `COG_HOST` variable. This is not a proper https://cog-book.operable.io/#_cog_server_configuration[Cog Server Configuration], but one specifically for use with this `docker-compose` example. This is the host that the Cog API will be made available at. Set this to point to your Docker host. If you're using https://docs.docker.com/machine/[docker-machine for example], this would suffice:

.Export Environment Variables
[source,bash]
----
export SLACK_API_TOKEN=<your_token>
export COG_HOST=$(docker-machine ip default)
----

Now it's time to run `docker-compose`. From the same directory containing the
`docker-compose.yml`, run the following with the bot token you just generated.

[source,bash]
----
export SLACK_API_TOKEN=xoxb-87931061512-notarealtokentLNjTMuxxozUo
docker-compose up
----

You should see Docker downloading and starting images for Cog, Relay and a
database. This might take a while, but once it's done starting up and has
connected you should start seeing logs like the following:

[source]
----
cog_1       | 2016-10-07T00:38:51.0504  (Cog.BusEnforcer:60) [info] Allowed connection for Relay 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
----

For the last step, let's check and see if our bot is available in the chat
room. Open up Slack and try the following command. Keep in mind that you'll
have to invite the bot to whatever room you first message it from.

[source,slack]
----
@cog help
----

You should see a response like this:

[source,slack]
----
@vanstee: I'm terribly sorry, but either I don't have a Cog account for you, or your Slack chat handle has not been registered. Currently, only registered users can interact with me.

You'll need to ask a Cog administrator to fix this situation and to register your Slack handle.
----

That's because Cog doesn't respond to people it doesn't know about. In the next
section we'll create a Cog user associated with your Slack user and give it
some permissions, so you can start running some commands.

=== Creating a User and Running a Command

It's pretty obvious that you'd be able to talk to a chat bot via chat. But,
we've included another way to interact with Cog without using chat. It's a
command-line tool named `cogctl` which is available on the Cog container we
just started with Docker Compose. To start using it run the following command
to start a new shell on the Cog container. You'll need to run all future
`cogctl` commands from this shell.

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose exec cog bash
----

Great now let's create you a new Cog user and associate that user with your
Slack handle. Your Cog user can be anything you want and is not specific to
your Slack account, which will come in handy when communicating with Cog
outside of chat.

[source,bash]
----
cogctl users create \
  --first-name="Patrick" \
  --last-name="Van Stee" \
  --email="patrick@operable.io" \
  --username="patrick" \
  --password="supersecret"

cogctl chat-handles create \
  --user="patrick" \
  --chat-provider="slack" \
  --handle="vanstee"
----

Great, now Cog should know who you are when running a command in chat. You can
try it out by running that `help` command again.

Great, you can run a command. But, not all commands can be run without
permissions. For instance, you'll notice if you type `@cog bundle list` into
chat, Cog responds with an error stating `Sorry, you aren't allowed to execute
'operable:bundle list'`. That's because bundle commands require permissions,
like many other important commands.

Using groups, roles, and permissions you can heavily customize who has
permissions to do what. But, for now, since we just want to explore what Cog
has to offer, add yourself to the `cog-admin` group, which will give you
permission to run all the pre-installed commands.

[source,bash]
----
cogctl groups add cog-admin \
  --user=patrick
----

You should now be able to list bundles or even install them as you'll see in
the next section.

=== Installing and Configuring a Bundle

So, you've already run your first command, but you might have noticed that Cog
only comes with a handful of pre-installed commands. How do we go about
installing more commands? By installing bundles, of course.

Bundles are groups of commands, permissions, and templates that can be
installed either by referencing a config file directly or by name in the
https://bundles.operable.io[bundle registry]. So, let's install one by running
a chat command.

---
image::images/max.png[Max,50,50,float="left"]
*Max Headroom* 10:52PM +
@cog bundle install ec2

---

And that's it. Now, if you run the `help` command, you'll notice the new `ec2`
bundle is listed under "Disabled Bundles". Before we can run a command, we need
to enable it, tell our Relay that it can run commands from this bundle, and
configure it with credentials.

---
image::images/max.png[Max,50,50,float="left"]
*Max Headroom* 10:52PM +
@cog bundle enable ec2 +
@cog relay-group member assign default ec2

---

Now the the ec2 bundle is enabled, but we still haven't
configured it yet. Let's set our api token with `cogctl`.

[source,bash]
----
echo 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "AKIBU34ZNOTAREALTOKENQ"' >> config.yaml
echo 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "YQ7h84BCvE4fJnotarealtokenO8zpAIbulblb6MCHkO"' >> config.yaml
echo 'AWS_REGION: "us-east-1"' >> config.yaml
cogctl dynamic-config create ec2 config.yaml
----

Now there's just one last step; making sure we have permission to run ec2
commands by adding some priviledges to the `cog-admin` group.

[source]
----
@cog permission grant ec2:read cog-admin
@cog permission grant ec2:write cog-admin
@cog permission grant ec2:admin cog-admin
----

Now try it out!

[source]
----
@cog ec2:instance list
----

=== Building and Running Cog from Scratch

To run Cog you'll need to start three separate processes: Postgres, Relay and
Cog itself, all of which will require a few dependencies.

* Postgres 9.4+
* Erlang 18+
* Elixir 1.3+
* Go 1.6+
* Docker 1.10.3+
* GCC

Downloading and installing Postgres 9.4+ should be straight
forward. Take a look at https://www.postgresql.org/download/[their download
page] for more details.

Next, let's build Relay. You'll need to install Go 1.6+ and Docker
1.10.3+. Why do we still need Docker? Bundles have the option to define an
image on Docker Hub in which to run the command. So, Relay needs to know how to
download those images and start containers to run some commands.

Download the source in your `$GOPATH` and build it.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/operable
git clone git@github.com:operable/go-relay.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/operable/go-relay
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/operable/go-relay
make
----

You should have an executable in `_build` ready to go. We'll come back to it in
a mintue.

Now, to build Cog. Cog is written in Elixir, which means you'll need to install
both Erlang 18+ and Elixir 1.3+. You can find more information about how to
install Elixir on their http://elixir-lang.org/install.html[installation guide].
Once you have Elixir installed run the following to clone the Cog repo,
download deps, setup the database, compile and run Cog.

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:operable/cog.git
cd cog
make setup run
----

You'll notice that the `run` target crashed as we didn't provide a
`SLACK_API_TOKEN` environment variable. To fully configure Cog and Relay we'll
need to set a few environment variables. If you need more customization than is
explained in this guide checkout the full listing of environment variables and
their descriptions for both <<Cog Server Configuration>> and <<Relay Configuration>>.

For now let's just provide the minimum to get things up and running. For Cog,
we'll just need to set `COG_SLACK_ENABLED` and `SLACK_API_TOKEN` as everything
else has a sensible default. You can get a `SLACK_API_TOKEN` for your bot by
creating a https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot[new bot integration]. So let's
try running Cog again, now with our token exported.

[source,bash]
----
export COG_SLACK_ENABLED=true
export SLACK_API_TOKEN=xoxb-87931061512-notarealtokenLNjTMuxxozUo
make run
----

To get Relay running, we'll need to supply both `RELAY_ID` and
`RELAY_COG_TOKEN` which are used to both identify our Relay and allow it to
connect to Cog. I would recommend using a uuid for `RELAY_ID` and a random
string for the `RELAY_COG_TOKEN`. If you have `uuid` and `openssl` installed
you could use the following commands like these to generate them. After,
exporting those variables we can run the run the binary we previously built.

[source,bash]
----
export RELAY_ID=`uuid` && echo $RELAY_ID
export RELAY_COG_TOKEN=`openssl rand -hex 12` && echo $RELAY_COG_TOKEN
export RELAY_DYNAMIC_CONFIG_ROOT=/tmp/dynamic_configs
_build/relay
----

You'll see a warning about a missing configuration file, which you can ignore
since we're not using one.

Ok, so now we have both Cog and Relay up and running, but they aren't actually
aware of each other yet. Because Cog was designed to be run with multiple
Relays on multiple hosts, we need to tell Cog about our Relay before it can
connect. It's worth noting, that in this example we've bound to `localhost` so
certain features like enforcing a matching `RELAY_TOKEN` are disabled. But, to
add a Relay to Cog, we need to build and run Cogctl.

Cogctl requires the same dependencies as Cog, Erlang 18+ and Elixir 1.3+.
Since we already installed those, pull down the source and run the following,
to grab the deps and compile an escript.

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:operable/cogctl.git
cd cogctl
mix escript
----

Now you'll have a `cogctl` executable in the current directory. Since we have
Cog's API running on the default host and ports, we don't need to create a
custom profile. But look at Cogctl's help output if you need to set any of
these.

Ok, now we just need to bootstrap Cog and create a record for our Relay. Here's
a snippet:

[source,bash]
----
./cogctl bootstrap
./cogctl relays create \
  --id=$RELAY_ID \
  --token=$RELAY_COG_TOKEN
----

And now you should be in business. But there's one last step we need to take
care of before you can run commands. You'll need to create an account for
yourself. Copying this run the Docker-based walkthrough, run this:

[source,bash]
----
./cogctl users create \
  --first-name="Patrick" \
  --last-name="Van Stee" \
  --email="patrick@operable.io" \
  --username="patrick" \
  --password="supersecret"

./cogctl chat-handles create \
  --user="patrick" \
  --chat-provider="slack" \
  --handle="vanstee"

./cogctl groups add cog-admin \
  --user="patrick"
----

And now you should be all set. For a quick walkthrough of installing your first
bundle and running a command, jump back up to the section titled "Installing
and Configuring a Bundle."

=== Connecting Cog to HipChat

Ok, so you've already installed Docker and Docker Compose.  Next, we'll need to
grab the `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.common.yml` and
`docker-compose.override.hipchat_example.yml` files from the Cog repo.

[source,bash]
----
curl -o docker-compose.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operable/cog/0.16.2/docker-compose.yml

curl -o docker-compose.common.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operable/cog/0.16.2/docker-compose.common.yml

curl -o docker-compose.override.yml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operable/cog/0.16.2/docker-compose.override.hipchat_example.yml
----

The `docker-compose.yml` defines which images to run and how they'll talk to
each other, while the `docker-compose.override.yml` sets values for the
environment variables passed into each container. The default
`docker-compose.override.yml` has everything you'll need to start a working Cog
instance. But, we recommend that you set each environment variable starting
with `BOOTSTRAP` to automatically create an admin user for yourself upon
startup.

Ok, we're almost ready to start Cog, but one last thing we'll need is a new
HipChat user for your bot. Invite a new user and login as that user and
navigate to the Profile page. First click on API Access to generate a new API
token; you'll need to allow all the scopes that start with "View" and "Send".
Then, navigate to XMPP/Jabber info to lookup the rest of the environment
variables you'll need.

Now it's time to run `docker-compose`. From the same directory containing the
`docker-compose.yml` and your edited `docker-compose.override.yml`, run the
following with the API token you generated and the XMPP configuration you
looked up.

NOTE: Your `HIPCHAT_JABBER_PASSWORD` is just your normal HipChat password for
that account and your `HIPCHAT_NICKNAME` is the unique mention name for your
user without the `@` prefix.

[source,bash]
----
export HIPCHAT_API_TOKEN=0bnYC5notarealtokenP8TxMfzPhtheRl2DkoNZ6
export HIPCHAT_JABBER_ID=479543_0000000@chat.hipchat.com
export HIPCHAT_JABBER_PASSWORD=sekr3t
export HIPCHAT_NICKNAME=cog
docker-compose up
----

Now you can head back to follow the section titled <<Creating a User and Running a Command>>,
as the rest isn't Slack specific. The only caveat is that when creating a
chat-handle, you'll need to specify `--chat-provider=hipchat` instead.
